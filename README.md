im still working on this but you can use it for a game with choices in dialogue . editable and you might need to add more commands to it for bettter use

two main folders for your access . dialogue.cs is a scriptable object and you need to add a file for dialogue and choices . both have ids which you need to use a number that for dialogue is unlimited and for choices is one . for dialogues add ids of choices you want to use which you have to count from the list and add a one to it . so the first dialogue in the list has id of 1 and etc . you can add voice if you like to it but doesn't matter the code needs a click effect which you can remove if you like . 

There are commands and you can add them for better use like speech and barter or etc that's up to you but i already wrote some commands so you know how it works .
there is a example scene that i suggest you look into for better understanding of the code

There is a need for Tmpro but if you like you can edit that out . also you need buttons for choices and each button has to connect to chooseChoice in DialogeMan , and have a int value each 1 more than the last and starting
with 0.
